Write a CloudFormation template that creates a stack which of the following resources:
- VPC with CIDR 172.20.0.0/16
- 3 Subnets of size /20 covering 3 availability zones, for example:
172.20.0.0/20 on us-east-1a
172.20.16.0/20 on us-east-1b
172.20.32.0/20 on us-west-1c
- A Security Group which opens SSH and HTTP ports to the world.
- An Internet Gateway
- An EC2 Instance.
* Optional:
Configure a UserData script in the EC2 Instance resource in CloudFormation so it will install Apache (like we did in one of the lessons)

Don't forget to use all available online resources such as Google, AWS official documentation and my CloudFormation template example:
